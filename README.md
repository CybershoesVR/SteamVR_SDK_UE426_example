## How you integrate Cybershoes without coding 
(Windows PC and SteamVR):  


* Run your game (from editor or compiled), go to SteamVR controller bindings, bind the Cybershoes (like so: https://youtu.be/5HI2Cu5YSb0) and click Replace Default Bindings.


* You can configure it so that the Cybershoes default trackpad runs into MovementAxisLeft and the CybershoesTrackpadPress into Sprint



* Now this will work on your PC.


* Use the slider on the receiver to adjust speed




If you need to publish your game/app, let us know then we can add your bindings to the driver. dev@cybershoes.com
