# SteamVR_SDK_UE426_example
 


## what works: 
* Cybershoes and Follow Cybershoes  
* bindings load altough game name was changed  
* packaged game tested on different machine  
* jumping / physics  
* grab objects and move    
* building, packaging 

## observe:   

* Vive Controller: does the engine (or the packaged game) create a custom binding for the Vive Controller that messes up the grab binding?
